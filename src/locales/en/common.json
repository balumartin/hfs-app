With a diverse academic background encompassing philosophy, history, Hungarian and French language and literature, she is committed to transdisciplinarity, seeking to contribute to a critical history of the present inspired by the works of Michel Foucault. Her fascination with somaesthetics is informed by contemporary practices in fashion design, notably sartorial practices. In 2022, she authored a Hungarian-language book examining the various media regimes within contemporary fashion. Her scholarly articles have been featured in journals such as the European Review, Cinema&Cie, Hungarian Studies, and the European Journal of Popular Culture.",

His professional field of interest includes hermeneutics, ethics, aesthetics, and pragmatism, especially neopragmatism. He is the author of four books (Chapters from the History of Western Philosophy from Thales to Hume (1997, Hungarian); Why Did Heidegger Become Heidegger? (2001, Hungarian); Basic Ethics (2004, Hungarian), Philosophy of the Late Richard Rorty (2016, Hungarain)) and has published numerous articles on philosophical hermeneutics, Richard Rorty’s neopragmatism, and Richard Shusterman’s somaesthetics. He is the editor in chief of Pragmatism Today (www.pragmatismtoday.eu , 2010-2024), and was the head of the Hungarian Forum of Somaesthetics (2018-2024) and was a Visiting Fulbright Professor at the UNCC for two academic semesters in 2005-2006. I met Richard Shusterman in Wroclaw in 2012. At that time, I had been a member of the Central European Pragmatist Forum for at least a decade, promoting and teaching pragmatist philosophy to my students and writing for various journals. I had been working primarily on Dewey and Rorty, but I only knew about Shusterman's somaaesthetics by reputation. In 2012, however, we became friends and I invited him to Hungary, where he had only been once before as a tourist. The result was the first conference on somaesthetics in Hungary in 2014, 'Aesthetic Experience and Somaesthetics' (Budapest, ELTE). Building on this success, we organized three more conferences ('The Soma as the Core of Aesthetics, Ethics and Politics' /Szeged, SZTE, 2017/; 'Somaesthetics: Between the Human Body and Beyond' /Szeged, SZTE, 2018/; 'The Promise of Pragmatist Aesthetics: Looking Forward after 30 Years' /Budapest, MOME, 2022), and in addition to numerous studies and conference proceedings in English, Somaesthetics and the Art of Life (Szeged, JATEPress, 2014.

In 2018, we established the Hungarian Forum for Somaesthetics (MSzF; Hungarian Forum for Somaesthetics, HFS), in order to be able to interact with existing somaesthetic organisations, associations and forums in other countries on the same level. I was its first president (2018-2024).",
